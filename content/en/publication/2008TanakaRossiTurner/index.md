abstract: This collaborative research, co-authored by Juliana B. Rossi and Aiko Tanaka during their doctoral studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), delves into the copper adsorption process on a novel silica-based adsorbent. The study provides comprehensive insights gained from batch and fixed-bed adsorption experiments, employing a complete experimental design. Under the guidance of Professor Christopher Turner, the research explores the practical applications of the developed adsorbent in real-world water treatment scenarios.
