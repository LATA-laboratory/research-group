abstract: This collaborative research, led by Juliana B. Rossi during her doctoral studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), introduces a novel silica-based adsorbent designed for the cost-effective and selective removal of copper from water sources. With collaboration from a fellow doctoral student from China and under the guidance of Professor Christopher Turner, the study addresses the growing need for efficient and affordable solutions in water treatment.
