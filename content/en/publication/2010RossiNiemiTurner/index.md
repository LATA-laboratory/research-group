abstract: This collaborative research, co-authored by Juliana B. Rossi, Mikko Niemi, and Professor Christopher Turner, introduces a novel approach to analyzing batch adsorption data through neural network modeling. The study, born out of interdisciplinary collaboration, aims to unravel the complexities of the copper adsorption process on the silica-based adsorbent developed in previous works. By incorporating the expertise of Mikko Niemi in neural networks, the research provides a sophisticated and data-driven understanding of the adsorption mechanisms.
