Juliana B. Rossi, a Brazilian scientist, forged her career in water treatment, graduating with a degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of São Paulo in 2000. Early in her journey, she delved into the intricacies of water quality, completing a year of scientific initiation and publishing her work on innovative organic compound removal using advanced oxidation methods. Her dedication led her to a pivotal role in the water treatment system of "SaborColheita Indústria de Conservas," followed by impactful studies at MIT, where she earned a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering in 2010. During her Ph.D., Juliana's research made notable contributions, particularly in the development of cost-effective silica-based adsorbents for selective copper removal.

She became a university professor at UFPR in 2011. At UFPR, she established the "Laboratório Ambiental para Tratamento de Águas (LATA)," where her leadership and expertise continue to shape innovative approaches to water treatment. Juliana's journey is characterized by a humble commitment to advancing sustainable solutions, both in academia and in practical applications addressing water quality challenges.
